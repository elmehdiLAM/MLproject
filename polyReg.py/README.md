## Introduction 
this project will explore three type of machine learning algorithmes ( regression, clustring, classification ) 
using two datasets (mall custommers history, airline client satisfaction ). <br>
 the project will use various machine learning algorithms : <br> 
1- linear Regression <br>
2- multiple linear regression <br>
3- polynomial regression <br>
4- clustring using Kmeans alogorithm <br>
5- classification using logistic regression <br>
6- classification using KNN <br>
7- classification using SVM  <br>
8- classification using decision tree <br>
## describing  datasets 
##### A- Mall customers datasets
You are owing a supermarket mall and through membership cards , you have some basic data about your customers like Customer ID, age, gender, annual income and spending score.
Spending Score is something you assign to the customer based on your defined parameters like customer behavior and purchasing data. 
##### B- Airline Passenger Satisfaction datasets
This dataset contains an airline passenger satisfaction survey. What factors are highly correlated to a satisfied (or dissatisfied) passenger
## algorithms results discussion 

## conclusion
- we should choose carefuly the processing algorithme for better accurancy <br>
- the data preprocessing is hardest part in building machine learning models
